# Chest-Ray-segmentation
We propose a deep learning framework to improve segmentation accuracy of the lung region in Chest X-Ray (CXR) images. The proposed methodology implements a “divide and conquer” strategy where the original CXRs are subdivided into smaller image patches, segmented them individually, and then reassembled to achieve the complete segmentation.
